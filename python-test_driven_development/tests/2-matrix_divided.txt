The matrix divided module

Import module:
    >>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided

Testing integers:
    >>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [7, 8, 9]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
    [[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [2.33, 2.67, 3.0]]

Testing floats:
    >>> matrix = [[1.4, 3.5, 4], [7, 8.9, 9.1]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
    [[.47, 1.17, 1.33], [2.33, 2.96, 3.03]]

Testing an empty matrix:
    >>> matrix = []
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    IndexError: list index out of range

Testing matrix against strings:
    >>> matrix = [[1.3, 2.4, 3.5], [7, 8, "9"]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Testing the matrix divided by 0:
    >>> matrix = [[1.3, 2.4, 3.5], [7, 8, 9]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 0)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

Testing the matrix divided by string:
    >>> matrix = [[1.3, 2.4, 3.5], [7, 8, 9]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, "8")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: div must be a number

Testing the matrix with different size rows:
    >>> matrix = [[1.3, 2.4, 3.5], [7, 8, 9], [3, 6, 9]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size
